# Raycast CHAT GPT-4 engine

The goal of this project is to create fully working raycast engine and create a simple game. The main idea is that me personally is not allowed to write any code by myself, everything should be created with CHAT GPT, even refactoring

### Currently working features:

1. Texture mapping on walls
2. Procudere generation map
3. Minimap
4. Enemy that can chase you by findpath algorithm
5. Player has weapon, can shoot and kill enemy (enemy will randomly spawned again)
6. Weapon has bobbing when player move
7. Enemy knock back when getting hit
